First, according to the experimental results, we speculate that the valuable features of PRCC/ChRCC on CT images are commonly overlooked, which indicates that the fewer trainable parameters the model has, the better the accuracy it achieves. Although the feature capacity of the models is correlated linearly with the number of parameters, the number of parameters is seemingly correlated with fitting situations in a parabola. In the lightest model, ShuffleNet, performance is the worst in these coverage models. The best performance is from the MobileNetV2, with a bigger capacity of parameters than ShuffleNet. However, as the number of parameters is continuously increasing, the accuracy is decreasing (ResNet-34). Importantly, too many trainable parameters in this task can cause model under-/overfitting (ResNet-50/ResNet-101). The relation between accuracy and parameters during the classification of small datasets needs further explanation and selection. However, this interesting finding shows the importance of feature capacity assessment of datasets and the right choice of models with a suitable size before promoting performances. Finally, we noticed that extreme data augmentation has little effect on training. We tried several ways to augment and amplify datasets to increase their size, which obviously did not affect the accuracy of the validation dataset.",-1),zt=e("This study had two main aims: 1) to make the automated classification methods easy to use with broad applicability to provide a highly accurate method that can be used in basic health units and deployed in medical centers with low-performance hardware and 2) to combine these methods with those used in federal studies, which can be used for multicenter studies and to increase model accuracy without the need to gather all the data. The deployment of such a model in devices at health centers will promote clinical treatment. Our future goal is to migrate this processing paradigm to other RCC subtypes. Although this study provides the first automated method for the radiological classification of PRCC/ChRCC subtypes, there are still some limitations. 1) The main limitation is the lack of multicenter validation, and the other limitations include the sizes of the training, validation, and testing datasets, which will be considered in future studies. Our methods used to avoid overfitting included data augmentation and ConvBNReLU but should have been more diverse. Also, due to the limited dataset capacity, the ROC curve was unsmoothed. 2) The underutilization of digital clinical data is another limitation. The conjunctive use of clinical and radiological data can further improve the prediction accuracy. 3) The underuse of multiphase sequences could be considered another limitation of our study. In our study, we exported images based on one patient\u2013one phase. 4) Our dataset was mainly obtained from East Asian patients, and since a population-based analysis reported that racial disparities exist between black and white people in kidney cancer ("),Yt={href:"http://gmade-studio.com/blog/publications/dl-based-classification/#B28",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Wt=e("Chung et al., 2015"),Kt=e("), the upshot of our study would have bias in the East Asian population. Multiple factors including race, gender, and age could be taken into consideration for further exploration. 5) Our validation dataset was based on a dataset from our hospital, but it was not the best choice and had a certain effect on the results of training. The ideal validation dataset should be based on three or more datasets from different institutes. The small size of the testing dataset could also have led to a controversy about the results of MobileNetV2, which need to be further tested in multiple centers. 6)\xA0Processing of datasets by experts may not be regarded as the best method. Ideally, an automated segmentation procedure contained in the pipeline may be a better choice. However, there were some barriers laid that could hardly be bypassed. We tried two proposals: individual tumor output and area output. We applied U-Net-based methods to draw ROIs and found that the methods of existing reports ("),Zt={href:"http://gmade-studio.com/blog/publications/dl-based-classification/#B29",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Xt=e("Fabian & Maier-Hein, 2019"),Vt=e(";\xA0"),Ot={href:"http://gmade-studio.com/blog/publications/dl-based-classification/#B31",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},qt=e("Hou et al., 2019"),Qt=e(";\xA0"),$t={href:"http://gmade-studio.com/blog/publications/dl-based-classification/#B30",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},eo=e("Ma, 2019"),to=e(") could not fit the need. In studies, tumor Dice scores were lower than 0.85 generally, which meant that some parts of tumor pixels could not be contained in the processed images and some radiological characters were lost unavoidably. The reason why we finally did not use this method was that this automated segmentation/classification-combined model had a performance lower than expected. Unless the method to improve the tumor Dice score obviously is developed, the automated segmentation\u2013classification model efficiency has a rare possibility to reach the baseline of clinical application. We also tried YOLO-v3-based detection and area segmentation; however, it did not show better performances compared with existing ML-based methods, which finally led to its abandonment. Besides the technological challenges, the main reason why we did not introduce an automated segmentation into the pipeline was that in this study we focused more on the classification, and the key point was realizing the classification of subtypes with low capacity under a smaller feature engineering preprocessing and more automated processing compared with ML-based classification methods. As a challenge in DL-based radiomics, automated segmentation is our next study orientation.

However, based on the result that a CNN-assisted diagnosis model with high diagnostic accuracy was developed in a single center of this study, it suggests that the AI research and development model adopted in this study has high clinical application potential in improving the accuracy of differential diagnosis of PRCC and ChRCC, at least in a single regional center. In the future, although there will be some difficult challenges in developing AI high diagnostic accuracy which was caused by some objective factors such as subtle potential differences in image feature led by the discrepancy between race and region and inability in high homogeneity in the imaging method, we still expect that the AI auxiliary renal tumor imaging diagnostic research can expand into different regions, different centers, and different races, together with bigger sample data to validate our conclusion, and can accurately classify as well as precisely and automatically segment multiple pathological types of renal tumor, with the aim of making it an auxiliary diagnostic imaging tool with wide clinical application prospects.</p><h2 id="conclusions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Conclusions</h2><p>To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first automated framework for differentiating PRCC and ChRCC that could produce reliable results.
